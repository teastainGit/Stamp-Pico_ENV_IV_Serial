A tested sketch with M5Stack Stamp-Pico (or any generic ESP32) using the new M5Stack ENV VI sensor.
Temperature, Humidity and Pressure prints out on Serial Monitor.
You must have recently re-freshed libraries for all the #includes and your specific board type.
You must set your I2C (SDA, SCL) as per your board.
Tested with Arduino IDE ver2.3.0.
